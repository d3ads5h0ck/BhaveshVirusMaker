 -- HOW TO RUN --
Goto: BVM > bin > Debug > BVM.exe
Problem? Do this: Goto 'BVM' folder, then goto 'bin' folder, then goto 'Debug' folder, find 'BVM.exe' there and run it.

 -- REQUIREMENTS --
 
1. Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 installed
2. Windows Operating System
3. Disabled ALL AntiVirus (Important!)

 -- BEFORE YOU START --

If your antivirus is not disabled, this program won't work at all! This is because there are raw shellcodes, shells, batch virus codes etc that are directly detectable by the Antivirus programs. 
If you don't trust this, you can see the source-code via Visual Studio or SharpDevelop.

 -- USAGE --
 
v1.0.0.8 onwards, you won't find the starting screen that the old versions had. The new version is smaller, has the same features and is efficient. The screen directly shows all the options available for you to run and you just have to click the button to run the stuff.

 -- FAQ's --
Q. Is this safe program?
A. If you don't trust me, you can view the source-code and see. That's why I've made it open-source.

Q. Why should I disable AntiVirus?
A. If you see the source-code, you will notice that to make any 'Batch Virus' my program compiles the source of the virus into a file. Due to to source containing the virus source, it is detected as multiple viruses, trojans, hack tool etc.. 

Q. Who made this/What's the use?
A. I'm a student who likes to code, I initially made this for myself so that I don't have to search for stuff on internet. I made this in 2013, but realeased it in 2015 because I thought I can add more features and it may help other people to learn about security, because it way lying around and I didn't use later on. This is for those who know a bit, but want help rather that searching this intenet for hours. It 'may' help people. I hope so..

Q. Can institutions use it?
A. I would be glad if anyone learns from it. Other conventinal software's collect user data, user information and other sneaky stuff. But I don't have any means to tell if anyone uses it or not. The only thing I can see is the 'number of downloads' on sourceforge webpage. That's the only window between me and the people who download this :'(


Read the "FUCKING DESCRIPTION" before flagging !! (Sorry this was old :P Peopl don't read anything nowadays!)

I told this several times and will keep telling that all virus creator are termed or detected as viruses because they have batch virus/other trojan codes in them so that you can create a virus on a click of button. Antivirus are programs which WILL ALWAYS term it as virus because of FUCKING CODES!!
Noobs don't seem to understand that. 
Noobs will remain noobs and never grow up to look at the SOURCE-CODE.
What more can I offer. Source-Code is the biggest thing you can get here to check the codes for yourself. I typed them from hands and they take LONG TIME to write..

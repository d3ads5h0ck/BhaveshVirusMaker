 -- BEFORE YOU START --

If your antivirus is not disabled, this program won't work at all! This is because there are raw shellcodes, shells, batch virus codes etc that are directly detectable by the Antivirus programs. 
If you don't trust this, you can see the source-code via Visual Studio or SharpDevelop.

 -- USAGE --
 
The first window is the main menu. In the left side there is a token telling the authencity of the program(though it's a VERY BAD concept.. It's for fun only).. 
The first option is to START, that means to reaveal the submenu which contains all the started items. This will slowly populate with other items as new updates will soon come.

 -- THE MAIN PROBLEM --
One of the main problem is that SourceForge and other app hosting websites block this app due to people flaging it as virus. 

Read the "FUCKING DESCRIPTION" before flagging !!

I told this several times and will keep telling that all virus creator are termed or detected as viruses because they have batch virus/other trojan codes in them so that you can create a virus on a click of button. Antivirus are programs which WILL ALWAYS term it as virus because of FUCKING CODES!!
Noobs don't seem to understand that. 
Noobs will remain noobs and never grow up to look at the SOURCE-CODE.
What more can I offer. Source-Code is the biggest thing you can get here to check the codes for yourself. I typed them from hands and they take LONG TIME to write..

 -- CONCLUSION --
